# Mailman

Use this skill when Codex Desktop needs the fastest path to pull recent Google Chat spec messages into the current conversation.

Interpret natural requests like these as valid mailman tasks:

- "mailman으로 최근 스펙 가져와"
- "tn 방에서 희조봇 메시지 3개만 가져와"
- "이 작업에 필요한 최근 API 스펙만 컨텍스트에 넣어줘"

This is the primary short-name skill. Follow the same workflow as `mailman-sandbox`:

1. Open the configured Google Chat space with browser tools.
2. Expand relevant threads and scroll until the needed messages are visible.
3. Extract a JSON snapshot.
4. Import it into the bundled Mailman runtime.
5. Render the latest threads back into the current Codex conversation.

When possible, infer `space`, `sender`, and `count` from the user's wording yourself so the interaction feels as short as Claude `/mailman`.
When possible, ask the runtime for only the user-requested space, sender, and count so the response stays compact.
